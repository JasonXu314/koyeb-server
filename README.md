# General Purpose Server

Maximizing the value of my koyeb free app :D

## Projects

---

### PubDev:

Backend server for PubDev, a platform for new web developers to try their hand at fullstack development in a free sandboxed, batteries-included environment.

## Development

---

You will need a local instance of MongoDB running. Be sure to set the `MONGODB_URL` and `LOCATION` environment variables (`LOCATION` should be the host location, so probably `localhost` for local development).
